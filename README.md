# next-episode

a simple script to jump between episodes in mpv

## Installation

The installation process is no different from other mpv scripts.

Install in one line:

```
$ git clone 'https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/next-episode.git' ~/.config/mpv/scripts/next_episode
```

Or manually download the folder and save it to `~/.config/mpv/scripts/`.
The location may differ depending on the operating system or if you use a custom fork of mpv.

## Usage

* <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Left arrow</kbd> &mdash; previous episode.
* <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right arrow</kbd> &mdash; next episode.
